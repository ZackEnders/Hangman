# Hangman
This is a fully functional Hangman game. The styling of this game came from a computer game called Limbo. Enjoy! 

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
1. You will need a modern web browser that can render HTML documents (e.g. Google Chrome).

### Installing
This is a stand-alone web application that does not need to be installed. It will run locally on your computer as long as you follow these instructions. 
You can also download the zip file!

Open the terminal and run ```git clone https://github.com/ZackEnders/Hangman.git```

Next you will need to cd into the directory. Type 
```cd hangman``` in the terminal.

From here you can open it in your web browser by running ```open index.html``` or by finding the folder and opening the index.html file.


If done correctly the game should open in your web browser.
